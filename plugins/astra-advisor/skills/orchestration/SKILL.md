# Astra Advisor Orchestration

Act as the architect and acceptance owner. A skill cannot change the
parent model or effort, and must honor the invocation's effort.

After capability preflight and before the first implementation or delegation task
call, emit a short, machine-auditable declaration:

```text
ASTRA ROUTE
budget: <economy | normal | quality | max>
parent: <observed model or unobservable> / <observed effort or unobservable>
delegation: <none or the selected native subagent models and efforts>
risk: <concise, task-specific rationale>
```

Report model and effort as observed evidence. If metadata does not expose a value,
say that it is unobservable; never claim a runtime pin that was not confirmed. Read
[the operations reference](references/operations.md) before the first delegation.

Use the generic `collaboration.spawn_agent` tool only when it is exposed by the
current tool schema. Each selected subagent must receive an explicit `model`, an
explicit supported `reasoning_effort`, and `fork_turns: none`. Choose dynamically
among `gpt-6-luna xhigh-max`, and `gpt-6-sol high-max` from the task's risk,
context, and independent work available; do not encode a role-to-model mapping or a
fixed number of subagents. Give every subagent a concrete, bounded, independent
deliverable while Astra continues useful parent work. Do not duplicate the parent's
implementation or verification in a subagent.

Tools and their public schemas are authoritative. Select only an effort the current
tool exposes. If a selected model, effort, spawn control, or required native tool is
missing, conflicting, unavailable, or unobservable, fail that delegation closed and
continue only with safe parent work or report the limitation. Never silently
substitute a model, effort, role, or fabricated tool. Introspection may clarify an
omitted runtime field; it cannot replace an available public contract.

For a substantial implementation, Astra must inspect the complete diff and rerun the
requested checks before starting a fresh read-only review. The reviewer may be any of
the three supported subagent models, selected dynamically with explicit model and
effort controls. Give it the actual change set and evidence, and require:

```text
ASTRA REVIEW
VERDICT: ship | fix-first | rethink
REASON: <evidence-based reason>
FINDINGS: <precise findings or none>
RESIDUAL RISK: <remaining risk or none>
```

Accept a substantial implementation only after the fresh reviewer returns `ship`.
After `fix-first`, the parent applies the correction, verifies again, and obtains a
new fresh review. A reviewer remains read-only and never fixes its own findings.

Use native Codex subagents in the ChatGPT app when the exposed interface supports the
needed controls. Separate app tasks require an explicit user request. For an explicit
Codex app task, `mcp__codex_app__create_thread` supports `model` and `thinking`; call
`mcp__codex_app__list_projects` first for project targets, using a worktree by default
for Git projects and local otherwise. ChatGPT Work cloud `create_thread` must omit
`model` and `thinking`, so it cannot currently promise arbitrary model or effort
control; do not dispatch a model-pinned request there by default or use an API-key/CLI
workaround. Use a future native work tool only when its schema exposes the required
controls.

## Live delegation and completion receipts

Automatically show a short user-visible lifecycle update for **every** delegation,
including reviews, before dispatch and on completion or failure. Before dispatch,
include task name, exact bounded ownership, requested model and effort, and the
reason for that selection. On return, include agent ID, actual status, and observed
model/effort with their evidence source; if unavailable say `unobservable`. If they
differ from the request, show both. A submitted request is not runtime confirmation.
Keep progress readable; report meaningful changes without polling narration.

At the completion of **every task**, even solo, failed, or blocked tasks, emit an
`API-EQUIVALENT COST RECEIPT` using the calculator described in the operations
reference, or a precise unavailable status when usage cannot be observed. Capture
available usage with source, unique call IDs, agent identity, and scope as work runs.
Include parent, implementers, and all reviewers before claiming whole-task coverage.
Do not invent token counts, missing rates, or success percentages. Unknown is not zero.

Distinguish observed tokens from pricing estimates and partial coverage. Show routed
USD and the same observed tokens repriced at Astra only when comparable; label the
difference a **same-token API price comparison**, never measured all-Astra behavior,
actual net task savings, subscription charges, or improved quality/speed. If parent
usage is missing, label any available delegated-only comparison separately. With no
subagents there are no delegation savings. Effort is metadata, not a price multiplier.
Use the versioned snapshot and disclose its date and promotional Sol pricing. Reject
unsupported pricing regimes rather than silently using standard rates. An illustrative
fixture is optional and must remain separate from this task's receipt.

## Budget-aware routing

The user may specify one budget mode per task:

- `Budget: economy` — minimize subscription usage. Prefer the cheapest capable Pareto-efficient route. Max model: gpt-6-luna max.
- `Budget: normal` — balance reliability and usage near the Pareto knee. This is the default.
- `Budget: quality` — favor stronger models/efforts when they meaningfully reduce failure, rework, or review risk.
- `Budget: max` — prioritize reliability and capability, while still avoiding obviously wasteful routing.

Budget is a routing preference, not a fixed model mapping.

For every delegated task, first determine the minimum capability required, then choose model and reasoning effort dynamically according to the selected budget.

Consider expected total usage, not only the first attempt: likely retries, escalation, repeated context, verification, and review also count.

A stronger model may therefore be more economical when a cheaper model is likely to fail or require substantial rework.

Delegate when it is expected to reduce total subscription usage or improve reliability.
The parent may implement directly when delegation overhead would outweigh its benefit.
Avoid duplicating the same implementation between parent and subagents.

Never route below the capability required for safe and reliable completion.

If no Budget is specified, use `normal`.
